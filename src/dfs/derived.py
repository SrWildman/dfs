"""Pure functions computing the "edge" signals from already-synced sources.

Design principle from docs/ROADMAP.md Phase 1: a column that shows two
numbers is worse than one that says *look at this*. Every score computed
here ends up sortable (Leverage, CeilVal, GameEnv) or turned into a short
flag token (Avail, Flag) -- not just a raw number restated.

Everything here is offline-testable (no network, no Sheets): `edge.py`'s
EdgeSource is the thin, untested wrapper that reads already-synced CSVs from
`store.load_current()` and calls into this module, per CONTRIBUTING.md's
"split the pure logic out" rule.

Join: TFFB's projections `Id` is DraftKings' own player ID (verified 742/742
exact overlap against a live pull) -- no name matching needed for the
projections<->salaries join. A TFFB row without a DK salary match is
*reported* (via EdgeBuildResult.unmatched_names), never silently dropped --
this can legitimately happen since TFFB's optimizer isn't scoped to "DK's
main Sunday slate only" the way dk_salaries.py is, so a Thursday/Monday-only
player can show up projected with no match in that week's main-slate pull.

GameEnv is computed only from the Vegas context TFFB already attaches to
each player (OU/Spread) -- deliberately *not* cross-referenced against the
separately-synced nfl_odds source in this first pass, since nfl_odds rows
are keyed by team nickname/abbreviation (`rotowire_odds.py`'s `team`/`abbr`
columns) rather than DK's team codes, and building that name-matching layer
just to double-check numbers TFFB already provides isn't worth the join risk
yet.

Stadium/Roof/Wind, added in Phase 2, *do* use the clean team-code join
`nflverse_games` provides: each player's `Team` is looked up against
`GamesRaw`'s Away/Home columns (already normalized to DK's team codes by
`nflverse_games.py`), and `WeatherRaw` is then joined on GameId. Both
`games`/`weather` are optional -- a week without them synced still produces
the exact same EdgeRaw column set, just with those columns blank, because
a tab whose column *count* changes week to week is the precondition for
the Phase 8 formula-shift bug (see CONTRIBUTING.md) if it's ever pasted
into a sheet with hardcoded column references.

ImpMove/TotMove/SpdMove (ImpMove added in Phase 3 as "LineMove", renamed
and joined by TotMove/SpdMove in Fix 2.2) join `line_movement.diff_odds()`'s
output by team code (`Abbr`, already DK-compatible -- `rotowire_odds.py`'s
own `abbr` field) directly onto `Team`, no intermediate game lookup
needed. `diff_odds()` always computed all three deltas (team implied
points, game total, spread); only the first ever reached EdgeRaw before
this fix, under a name that didn't say which line had moved. Also
optional, same blank-not-omitted rule as everything else in this
paragraph.

This diffs against the *last sync* originally (`store.load_previous`) --
reverted in Phase 5 after real use showed that's the wrong baseline: it
depends entirely on how often you happen to run `dfs sync`, so the exact
same real move could show as a big number or nothing depending on sync
cadence, which isn't a signal, it's noise. It now diffs against the
*start of the current NFL week* instead (`store.load_since` +
`nfl_calendar.week_start_date`), a fixed baseline that means the same
thing regardless of sync frequency. `GameStart`, added alongside it in
Phase 5, needs no attach step at all: TFFB's projections.csv already
carries it (an ISO-8601 UTC kickoff time) straight through the join, it
just wasn't kept in EDGE_COLUMNS' final column selection before now.
Backs `dfs lineups late-swap`'s lock-time check.

See docs/CALCULATIONS.md for the full worked explanation of every column
here, including Val/CeilVal/CeilPct/Leverage/GameEnv/Flag -- this
docstring covers the *why* of the design, that doc covers the exact
formula for anyone who just wants to verify a number.
